For this project I no longer have the source code but I decided to put it
in here as it was made by me 100%.

Instructions on how to play:

	Arrows or left joystick to move from one pillar to another
	Green spin represents where you can move next
	Flying over enemies will destroy them
	The enemies with the wall will stop and damage you
	The goal is to destroy all the red enemies
